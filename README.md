# Object detection and tracking on the Road.

The project involves developing/building a model which identifies all target objects and determines the category and position information. This model should be able to detect multiple objects and segmentation in a moving video for e.g. Image tagging, lane detection, drivable area segmentation, road object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, multi-object detection tracking, multi-object segmentation tracking, domain adaptation, and imitation learning.

# Literature Review

    How to read a machine learning research paper: 
      1. Read abstract
      2. Read conclusion
      3. Read introduction
      4. If you are still interested look through the paper, look at pictures, formulas and algorithms.
      5. If you are still interested go through each statemented step by step, read references as needed, reproduce all maths, walk through algorithms.
